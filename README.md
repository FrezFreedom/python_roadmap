## Python Basic Programming Roadmap

This roadmap is designed for individuals who are interested in learning Python as their first programming language and wish to establish a solid foundation in computer science.

##### Here are the key highlights of this roadmap:

- This course is offered completely free of charge, although donations are welcome to enhance its quality and effectiveness.
- The roadmap has been developed by an experienced instructor with a decade of teaching experience in programming for both computer and non-computer students.
- Each section of the course includes practical problems that can be evaluated using a system powered by hotcodes.org.
- Upon completing this course, you will have a strong foundation that will enable you to confidently learn any programming language of your choice.
